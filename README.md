# Piaggio WebScraper & Script/Macro data entry

This was my first project on a job, which was a self assigned project with the goal being to avoid stressing my hands and eyes by automating the entry clerk process.

The scope ended up being a lot bigger after my 7 months of work (gov program) as I ended up cooperating with the site admin for more features but within 2 weeks the basic functionalaty was up and working.

**Quick comparison and showcase of the scripts / macro working can be found on Comparison Piaggio.mp4.**

## Features and functionalities

* Web scrap of all with accesories on related sites of Piaggio companies (Piaggio,Vespa,Aprilia e.t.c.)
* Data extraction from .pdf
* Download and sorting of all images for specified Moto
* Macro for sorting & entry of extra codes
* Convertion of data to Excel sheet
* Automated data entry for business site with Excel sheet

## Documentation

There's a full pdf documentantion in Greek but due to the nature of the task, I would like to avoid more exposure of the tools / scripts for the security of the business.
The documentation icludes:

* Introduction
* Terminology
* FAQ
* Instruction steps (including code changes for different behaviours)
* Troubleshooting (if it shows this behaviour or this error, solution is ...)
* Improvements

The aim of the documentation was to make it potentially possible for the business owners themseleves to work with it if they could learn a thing or two more about computers with my minimal goal being readable to any programmer or me.
